This - Hermetic builds involve a controlled build process where all resources and dependencies must pass through the build system. This ensures that the build system has full visibility and control over the dependencies needed for the build. By minimizing external dependencies and enforcing a centralized management approach, hermetic builds aim to establish a predictable and reliable build environment.

While hermetic builds themselves do not directly guarantee security or reliability, they indirectly contribute to these aspects. By restricting unfettered access and preventing unverified dependencies, hermetic builds mitigate potential vulnerabilities and inconsistencies. The focus is on creating a controlled and self-contained build environment that enhances security and reliability.

Note: The use of external tools like Cachi2 for providing dependencies can still align with hermetic builds, as long as they adhere to the controlled and self-contained nature of the process. The primary goal is to ensure the build system maintains oversight and authority over all dependencies.

Or this: Hermetic builds encompass a build process that prioritizes accurate and complete provenance generated by the build pipeline. While ensuring complete network isolation is an additional and ancillary aspect, it can be related to or enabled within the hermetic build approach.

The primary focus of hermetic builds is to establish a build pipeline that captures and maintains a precise record of the build's origin, dependencies, and modifications. This emphasis on provenance allows for better traceability, reproducibility, and auditability of the build process. By having comprehensive visibility into the entire pipeline, hermetic builds enable the identification and resolution of issues, facilitate collaboration, and support the long-term maintenance of the build.

Additionally, achieving network isolation can be part of the hermetic build strategy. By isolating the build process from external network access, hermetic builds minimize potential risks and variations introduced by external factors. However, it's important to note that complete network isolation is not an inherent requirement of hermetic builds but rather an auxiliary measure that can be implemented to enhance security and reliability.

In summary, hermetic builds primarily focus on ensuring accurate and complete provenance through the build pipeline, with network isolation being an optional aspect that can further support the goals of traceability, reproducibility, and security.
